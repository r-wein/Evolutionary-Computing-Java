# EVOLUTIONARY COMPUTING
Evolutionary Computing (EC) is a software engineering paradigm based on Charles Darwinâ€™s theory of evolution.  An EC System 
functions by using elements of natural selection, genetic inheritance, and mutation in order to solve a problem.  This program is able to generate an equation which will equate a given set of x and y coordinates.
